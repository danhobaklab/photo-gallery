# Photo Gallery
Image Gallery Prototype using JavaScript

You can run a prototype here: <a href="http://www.dahyepark.com/photo-gallery/">Photo-Gallery</a> (Running on mobile recommended.)

This is a quick prototyping exercise. I used HTML/CSS/JavaScript to prototype of Photo Gallery. The main concern is a smooth  transition between two views, a grid view and a detailed photo view. Also, gestures to browse photos and dismiss the detailed view were implemented.

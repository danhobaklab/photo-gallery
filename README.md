# Photo Gallery
Image Gallery Prototype using JavaScript

You can run a prototype here: [Photo-Gallery](http://www.dahyepark.com/photo-gallery/) (Running on mobile recommended.)

This is a quick prototyping exercise. I used HTML/CSS/JavaScript to prototype of Photo Gallery. The main concern is a smooth  transition between two views, a grid view and a detailed photo view. Also, gestures to browse photos and dismiss the detailed photo view were implemented.
